# Reflection Questions 

## Question 1

### It would be interesting to see the information displayed in a timeline format, which you would be able to scroll over in an interactive way. For example "name" could be at the beginning of the timeline on the date you were born, and when you scroll over the date there could be a popup that includes a baby image. Nickname could be 5 years later (or whenever that nickname came to be), first day of school could be 7 years later, etc. This way, people that come across your profile can see the evolution of you and your information in a visual manner. I think that this kind of layout would be especially useful and interesting for historians, because you are able to see how the individual has evoled through historical life events, which has ultimately led to the end of the timeline; where they are today.

## Question 2

### The researcher should have the responsibility to ensure that all participants know what is expected of them. I believe that this should not only include aid in setting up the various tools, but also an outline with examples of what should be done to attain full marks. The researcher should also be available to answer any questions. Perhaps in this case, where researcher to participant ratio is quite high, the researcher could set up a forum with frequently asked questions. Since the assignemnt is graded on participants setting up a profile that includes personal data, the participants should have full rights to view their end product. For this assignment I believe that the participant should be able to edit their information as they see fit. However, participants should not have the right to view another persons profile unless specifically stated in a privacy setting (i.e., the true, false script).

## Question 3

### In order to have a more detailed timeline, there would need to be more fields. Additional fields could be: high school graduation date, first year of university, year major was chosen, expected graduation date, favourite show, etc. One limitation is that the timeline would be focused on dates. This may create obstables if the participants are not able to remember the specific date of an event. For example, in the year of 2019 my favourite show was The Office- but it's difficult for me to say even the exact month that I started really enjoying the show. A second limitation is getting the participants to provide enough information about themselves to create a life-long timeline. A third limitation would be the skill level the researcher has to create this kind of data structure. To create an interactive timeline such as this, it would most likely take advanced coding or using a third party tool/website.
